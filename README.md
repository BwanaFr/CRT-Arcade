# CRT-Arcade
## Presentation
This project is a build of a CRT arcade machine based on a Raspberry PI, and using a 17' CRT screen.

## Hardware
The main logic board will be a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)  version 4.
The screen used is a [Elo 1781C CRT Touchmonitor](https://www.elotouch.com/1787c-discontinued-apr-2007.html) acquired on eBay (brand new). This open frame monitor features a VGA input and a USB/serial touchscreen interface.
Dual player is possible thanks to two joysticks and associated buttons connected to the Raspberry Pi GPIO.
Sound will be generated by two 3' speakers located in cabinet.

## Software
The software running on the Raspberry Pi is [Retropie](https://retropie.org.uk/), an excellent software to launch many emulators.
